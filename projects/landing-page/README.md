# Landing Page Project

The landing page project is a vertical multi-section page with a navigation bar at the top.
The Navgiation bar is used to smoothly scroll to the desired sections and each desired section is highlighted along with highlighting its name in the nav-bar
There's also a go-to-top button that will make it easier for you to reach the top with one click rather than scroll all the way to the top. 

This project is given by Udacity/EgFWD

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To make use of this project, all you need to do is run the index.html file on any browser.
Techniques used: HTML, CSS & JS ES6

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
Dependencies: None
JS Version: ES2015/ES6 
JS Standard: ESlint

The js is linked at the bottom of the page, this is to avoid any errors before the DOM content has been loaded.
Another way would have to link it at the head and using the DOMContentLoaded event, however this was not necessary in this project.
